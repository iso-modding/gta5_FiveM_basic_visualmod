
		Discord server - isotonic @ https://discord.gg/esCh2hktSd - EVCO lights mod (Evenly colored)

		
		

		Basic visual mod for FiveM
		All timecycles mods been modified to same values so is easy to spot changes
		w_clear.xml been modified to set a specific look that's easy to deviate from and customize
		All LODs light files been modified to white color and lowered the intensity
		Most street lights props were modified to white color and lowered the intensity  

		How to use:
		1. Add the extracted folder files to your server config or place it on the right directory
		2. Extract "stream" folder, I cant upload 800+ files here.
		3. For me, using QBCore, the structure looks like this: modding_server\resources\[standalone]\tcmods\
		4. Restart the server and check resources page/logs see if the mod is loaded
		5. If is loaded, press f8 to access the console on FiveM and write "weather clear" (no quotes)
		6. You should see the new look without it except for the water which will get very smooth right after the command
		
		How to customize it ?
		First you need know what area in the city you want to modify
		Open CodeWalker and from drop down menu select "Timecycle mods"
		Navigate around see what timecycle you want to modify, eg: overwater, norain, etc 
		With the RPF Explorer open, extract the 4 timecycle_mods on a different folder
		Open the file and search for the timecycle mod name you want to copy proprieties from
		Copy/paste/overwrite settings from the original unmodified file to this mod xml file
		Make adjustments as needed, such as colors/fog/blur/dof etc.
		You will need to restart the server and re-open FiveM after each set of changes
